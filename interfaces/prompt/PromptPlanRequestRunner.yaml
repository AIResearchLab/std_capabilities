description: "This capability depends on the prompt tools stack functionalities and allows an decision making authority such as an
              LLM to recieve a request to create a new plan at the end of an execution plan. This capability can can be trigged with 
              an xml command such as 
              '<Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRequestRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRequestRunner replan=false/>'. 
              This will prompt the decision making authority to create a new execution plan either to continue the current plan or to 
              focus on a new task depending on the state of the robot. This capability needs to be in every execution plan created and 
              needs be the capability before the last in any  plan. Any and all execution plans calculated by this capability need to 
              be contained within <Plan> and </Plan> xml tags. Capabilities within the execution plan can be organised using sqeuntial, 
              parallel and recovery control flows. Capabilities in the sequential control flow will be triggered one after the other 
              depending on precceding capability's successful execution. Capabilities under sequential control flow need to be contained  
              within <Control name=sequential> </Control> xml tags. Capabilities in the parallel control flow will be triggered all 
              at once and will be executed parallely. Capabilities under parallel control flow needs to come within <Control name=parallel> 
              </Control> xml tags. Capabilities in the recovery control flow will be triggered one after the other depending only on  
              precceding capability's failed execution. Capabilities under recovery control flow need to come within <Control name=recovery>
              </Control> xml tags. Upon the successful execution of this capability, another capability need to be executed for verifying 
              and starting the execution. It can be done via '<Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPlanResponseRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPlanResponseRunner/>' 
              xml command. A most basic plan with all compulsory runners is as follows,
              <?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8?>
              <Plan>
                  <Control name=sequential>
                      <Event name=std_capabilities/OccupancyGridRunner provider=std_capabilities/OccupancyGridRunner/>
                      <Event name=std_capabilities/PromptOccupancyRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptOccupancyRunner/>
                      <Event name=std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner provider=std_capabilities/RobotPoseRunner/>
                      <Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPoseRunner/>
                      <Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRequestRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPlanRequestRunner replan=false/>
                      <Event name=std_capabilities/PromptPlanResponseRunner provider=std_capabilities/PromptPlanResponseRunner/>
                  </Control>
              </Plan>
